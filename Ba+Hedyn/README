This folder contains all the programs needed to run the dynamics of the helium-induced transitions in the dynamics of photoexcited Ba+ Ba+ in  He nanodroplets. Excited state dynamics are simulated with the Molecular Dynamics with Quantum transitions combined with the Zero-Point averaged Dynamics(ZPAD), using a diatomic in molecules model hamiltonian with the inclusion of SO couplings. MDQT is a trajectory surface hopping method.
