This folder contain the programs to simulate the laser alignment of CH3I molecule attached to an He atom, to understand the experimental alignment dynamics of CH3I in He nanodroplets.
It contains two subfolders, one with the programs for the dynamics and the other contains the code to obtain and check the CH3I-He potentials.
